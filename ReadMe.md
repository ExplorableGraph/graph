# Graph Origami

This is the main repo for the Graph Origami project, encompassing:

- A generalized programmatic interface for treating data as a particular type of [directed graph](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Directed_graph>) called an _explorable graph_
- A library to facilitate working with explorable graphs
- A set of experimental tools and apps built using explorable graphs

# Developer co-operative

The Graph Origami project is a **developer co-operative**.

Only co-op members should use the project for anything beyond tire-kicking experiments and evaluations.

At a minimum, members should:

1. Share their intended use of the project with the other project members. This should be done when you've begun investing any non-trivial effort to use the project. It is not necessary to reveal confidential information, but it is required to share one's general intent.
