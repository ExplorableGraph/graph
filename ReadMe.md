# Graph Origami

This is the main repo for the Graph Origami project, an ongoing research project that encompasses:

- A generalized programmatic interface and [pattern](https://graphorigami.org/pattern/) for treating data as a particular type of [directed graph](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Directed_graph>) called an _explorable graph_. This pattern could be used in many programming languages; Graph Origami itself uses JavaScript.
- A [core library](https://graphorigami.org/core/) to facilitate working with explorable graphs
- An [expression language](https://graphorigami.org/language/) for traversing graphs and evaluating functions
- A general-purpose [command-line interface](https://graphorigami.org/cli/) for easily calling JavaScript from the shell, and for manipulating files and data in the shell
- A [framework](https://graphorigami.org/framework/) for creating digital content, such as web sites and documentation, using graph concepts

The fundamental interface for defining a node in an explorable graph is small; see the first link for details. This abstraction can be applied to functions, data, file system folders, web sites, and network resources. This permits the creation of a large set of tools that can traverse such structures, letting you as a developer work with them at a higher level.

# Project status

Graph Origami is a research project started in 2020 by [Jan Miksovsky](https://jan.miksovsky.com/). Jan's used the project to create a number of applications and web sites, and is currently collecting feedback on the concepts, tools, and documentation.

At this early stage, if you're interested in the project, please introduce yourself to Jan.

Bugs are an unavoidable aspect of software development â€” but a lousy way for you to introduce yourself to someone. If you find an issue and haven't already said hello, please say hello first.
