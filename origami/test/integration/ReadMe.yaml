#
# This folder contains integration tests that confirm the expected interaction
# of multiple parts of the Origami system. These tests are defined in YAML files
#
# This file itself is a sample YAML-based test used to test the testing
# infrastructure itself. It demonstrates the expected format of the YAML test
# files.
#
# * Each file defines a single suite of tests.
# * Each suite defines a `tests` array of tests.
# * Each test has a `title`, a `fixture` value, and an `expected` value.
# * The `fixture` is an object defining an Origami graph. This graph should
#   contain at least one value named `actual.ori`.
# * The `actual.ori` value should be an Origami expression that will be
#   evaluated in the context of the `fixture`. The expression can reference
#   other values in the fixture by name.
# * The result of evaluating `actual.ori` will be compared via `deepEquals` to
#   the `expected` value. If the two values are not equal, the test will fail.

name: Sample test suite for YAML-based integration tests

tests:
  - title: Passing test
    fixture:
      actual.ori: "'This evaluates to a plain string.'"
    expected: "This evaluates to a plain string."

  - title: Test with fixture
    fixture:
      message: "Hello"
      actual.ori: message
    expected: "Hello"

  # Uncomment to see a failing test.
  # - title: Failing test
