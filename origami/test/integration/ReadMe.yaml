#
# This folder contains integration tests that confirm the expected interaction
# of multiple parts of the Origami system. These tests are defined in YAML
# files.
#
# This file itself is a sample YAML-based test used to test the testing
# infrastructure itself. It demonstrates the expected format of the YAML test
# files.
#
# * Each file defines a single suite of tests.
# * Each suite defines a `tests` array of tests.
# * Each test has a `title`, a `fixture`, and an `expected` value.
# * The `fixture` object defines an Origami graph. This graph contains at least
#   one value named `actual.ori`.
# * The `actual.ori` value is an Origami expression that will be evaluated in
#   the context of the `fixture`. The expression can reference other values in
#   the fixture by name.
# * The result of evaluating `actual.ori` will be compared via `deepEquals` to
#   the `expected` value. If the two values are not equal, the test will fail.
