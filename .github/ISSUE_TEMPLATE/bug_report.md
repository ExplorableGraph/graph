**Bugs are a lousy way to say hello.** If you haven't already done so, please introduce yourself to [Jan Miksovsky](https://jan.miksovsky.com/contact.html) and say hello first!

Begin with a clear and concise description of the bug.

**Steps that reproduce the issue**

* When possible, please post a link to a repro case on an online code editor such as [Glitch](https://glitch.com) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io).
* Please use the plainest code possible to reproduce the issue. It's not feasible for bug investigators to install and learn new libraries, frameworks, languages, etc., just to investigate a single bug.

**Expected behavior**

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
